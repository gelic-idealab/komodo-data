# Komodo Data pipeline

## What is it? 
Komodo Data processes and aggregates data captured from Komodo sessions. It ingests the large binary files generated by the relay server during recorded sessions, parses the data, and inserts it into a relational database. It also performs basic feature extraction and aggregation on the data. 

## Setup
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run
```
$ chmod +x run.sh
$ ./run.sh
```
